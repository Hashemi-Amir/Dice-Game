# Dice-Game
## Introduction
This is a fun-to-play dice game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game's objective is to be the first player to reach 10 points to win.

## Rules
* Two players play the game. 
* Each player takes turns rolling a six-sided dice.
* The number rolled on the dice represents the number of points earned for that turn.
* If a player rolls a 1, they lose all their accumulated points for that turn and it becomes the next player's turn.
* Players can choose to "Hold" their current points at any time during their turn. When a player holds, their accumulated points are added to their total score.
* The first player to reach or exceed 10 points wins the game.
* Once a player wins, the game will freeze, and by clicking on the New Game button the game will be reset and both players' scores will be set back to 0.
